the character of the district surrounding the Capitol, as indicated by
the apartment houses and tree-lined streets.</p></div>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Scarcely a generation has passed during the evolution of the airplane
from a ridiculous dream to a practical factor in the work of the world.
Men who once read with derision, or only passive interest at best, of
the experiments of Langley, Chanute, and the Wrights have seen the
airplane developed suddenly into an indispensable instrument of war and
an agency of demonstrated value and of such diversity of application
that its future is hard to estimate.</p>

<p>The navigation of the air has accomplished much in many fields. Not only
does it offer a new means of efficiency in military reconnaissance,
rapid delivery of mail, fire patrol of forests, and the constantly
increasing number of commercial and scientific pursuits to which it is
being adapted; but it has also opened a new world to the geographer, the
physiographer, and the geologist.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Airplane Photography: Its Development and Application</span></h3>

<p>Very early in the war the airplane was recognized as a useful, in fact a
necessary, means of observing enemy positions and movements. But the
speed of the airplane was found to preclude the taking of more than the
most hurried of notes during a flight, and notes written from memory are
not the most satisfactory. Photography was found to obviate this
difficulty. The ability of the camera to make instantaneous exposures
and fix a clear image on a photographic plate enabled the observer to
obtain a record not only of the scenes that he had viewed but also of
many that he might have missed while engaged in the necessary business
of watching the sky for the enemy&mdash;a record that for detail and accuracy
could not be approached by the most elaborate notes or the most graphic
description. Immedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span>ately inventive genius was set at work to adjust the
mechanism of the camera to the demands of air photography and to prepare
the rapidly working films and highly sensitized paper necessary for the
best results.</p>

<p>So satisfactory were the results and so great are the possibilities of
further adaptation that there is an unfortunate tendency on the part of
certain enthusiasts to make exaggerated claims that may react to retard
progress. This is particularly true in the use of the air photograph in
mapping. There are limitations to this use of air photography. It cannot
be reasonably expected to do away entirely with the ground work of the
surveyor. Rather, the camera is to be regarded as one of the instruments
of the surveyor. Observation from the air can never take the place of
close examination of the ground, but it can be of great use in the
location and study of land forms and geologic relations. Air photography
is only an added means of obtaining information, although it promises to
become a very important means.</p>

<p>Observations from the air described in numerous reports and articles in
geographic magazines during the war and since its close indicate that
air craft, especially in connection with air photography, can be of
great use in studying the physical features of the face of the earth. In
order to make a practical test of the use of the airplane in the study
of geography the writer spent about nine months during the year 1920
making flights, taking pictures from air craft, and gathering
information from various sources. This book embodies the chief results.</p>

<p>The material presented here is by way of illustrating the possibility of
using the airplane and airplane photography as a means of securing
information that should become increasingly useful in the study of
geography, and of showing geographic and geologic features better than
in any other way. The views have been chosen to illustrate the three
uses of air photographs with which this book deals&mdash;the presentation of
new views of subjects of popular interest and the practical value of
such views; the study of land forms from a new and advantageous point<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
of view; and the use of the air photograph as an aid in mapping.</p>

<p>In presenting these illustrations there is no intention that the list of
types should be considered in any sense complete. Physiographic
observation from the air is a relatively new undertaking, and results
are limited and imperfect. As improvements in mechanism and technique
are made, observations will be extended and better photographs and a
greater variety of them will be secured. Such as are presented here,
however, serve to demonstrate that the air photograph will come to be
recognized as a valuable source of information for the student of
geography and geology.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Acknowledgments</span></h3>

<p>The results here presented were secured by the co-operation of the Air
Services of the United States Army and Navy. Hydroplanes were placed at
my disposal on several occasions, and a number of flights were made over
water bodies, particularly over the Potomac River, Chesapeake Bay, and
New York Harbor. But the information was gathered chiefly through the
Army Air Service. Many flights were made in army planes, some for
general observation, others for photographing specific objects. Also the
army photographers, particularly those at Langley Field, near Newport
News, Va., made several photographic trips at my request, and a large
number of prints were furnished from negatives stored at this and other
flying fields.</p>

<p>In this connection I wish to express appreciation for the many
courtesies extended by Major General C. T. Menoher, U. S. A., Chief of
Air Service at the time the work was done, and by Major J.W. Simons,
Jr., A.S., Acting Administrative Executive, Air Service. These officers
placed at my disposal every facility of the service that I could use. It
would be a pleasure, if space allowed, to mention the names of the
numerous pilots and other officers to whom I am directly indebted for
the safe completion of some of the most thrilling adventures of my life.
I must, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> mention the officer to whom I am perhaps more indebted
than to any other. My introduction to this study was through Major J.W.
Bagley of the United States Army Engineering Corps, who has done much
toward making the camera a valuable instrument in mapping.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Through
his active interest I became acquainted with the officials of the Army
Air Service, who gave the necessary authorization for flights and for
securing most of the photographs used to illustrate this book. During
the time spent at this work I retained my position as geologist of the
United States Geological Survey. Hence the work is one of co-operation
chiefly between the United States Army Air Service and the United States
Geological Survey, and to a lesser degree with the United States Navy
Air Service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_1" id="page_1">{1}</a></span></p>

THE VIEWPOINT<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 1 to 4</span>)</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oblique and Vertical Airplane Photographs</span></h3>

<p>Air photographs are, in general, of two sorts, depending upon whether
the photograph was taken with the camera pointing vertically or
obliquely downward. In either case the air photographer is free from the
limitations that hamper the ground photographer in choosing a point of
view. For he can ascend to any desired height and not only select an
advantageous position from which to photograph the feature which he
wishes to emphasize but also, at the same time, avoid obstacles which
might obstruct his view from the ground. Vertical photographs are
preferable where the accurate location of objects is desired. When
properly taken they serve many of the purposes of maps and are, in many
ways, even more useful than maps. They furnish the untrained mind with
much of the information that the trained mind reads from a topographic
map and, in addition, supply details and relations that a map cannot
depict. Exact accuracy, however, cannot be claimed for them until they
have been corrected for distortion and adjusted to some system of
controls.</p>

<p>Where the photograph is to be used as a means of securing a more
advantageous view of a subject than can be had from the ground rather
than as a map on which distances are to be scaled off, the oblique
photograph is probably the more desirable, since it is as easily
intelligible as a photograph taken laterally. The advantage of such
photographs is obvious. To the architect, the landscape gardener, the
city planner is given the opportunity to study their projects free from
all obstructions yet in such perspective that their relations to their
surroundings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> brought out as would be possible by no other means.
Views like that of West Point (Fig. 3) are occasionally to be had from
some hilltop, but the limited choice of position on the ground contrasts
sharply with the unlimited choice in the air.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Elements to Be Recorded</span></h3>

<p>Air photography is by no means simple. Much still remains to be done by
way of adapting the camera to its peculiar demands. Its present degree
of perfection, of course, is largely due to the impetus given its
development during the war because of its great importance in military
reconnaissance. The adaptation of the camera to operation from the
airplane might be described with profit but will be passed with slight
mention because it is the results of air photography rather than the
mechanism that are to be considered here. Technically, a photograph of
the earth’s surface may not be a map, but, given certain means of
interpretation, it can be made to serve as such. In using air
photographs, particularly the vertical ones, it is desirable to know the
scale, which is dependent upon the altitude at which the exposure is
made; the angle of the lens; and the variation from the vertical, in
order to make corrections for distortion. Therefore, it is desirable
that each photograph show the altitude, date, time of day, and position
of the lens at which the exposure was made. Cameras have been
constructed that automatically record these data on each negative. This
information is illustrated in Figure 2. The circular symbol at the left
in the white strip at the top of the photograph represents a circular
level, or inclinometer. The small round dot close to the center of the
inclinometer indicates that, at the time the exposure was made, the axis
of the lens was very nearly vertical. The symbol in the center of the
white strip indicates an altitude of about 9,800 feet, and that at the
right, that the exposure was made 7 seconds after 11 <small>A.M.</small> The other
symbols record that this photograph was No. 13 of a series made at
Rochester, N. Y., October 23, 1920, with an Eastman mapping camera known
as K-2. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> symbol 8-P is non-essential and records that this negative
is No. 8 of panchromatic film.</p>

mapping camera, photographed with the body of the picture showing roads,
streams, orchards, cultivated fields, etc. For explanation of the
symbols, see the text.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The information given by the symbols is corroborated by the picture.
Orchard and shade trees appear as circular dots in place of the
elongated images characteristic of pictures taken obliquely downward,
and the short, squat shadows denote exposure near midday. Shocks of corn
standing in the fields show that the season is autumn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Read Airplane Photographs</span></h3>

<p>Not all the features, however, are so easily recognizable. Oblique
photographs are often more readily interpreted than ordinary
photographs, since they combine with the usual view the essentials of a
plan; but in vertical photographs very few objects present an appearance
that is natural in the light of our experience as lateral observers. The
uninitiated, on attempting systematically to identify the features of a
vertical photograph, find a very large number that are foreign in
appearance. A necessary preliminary is an acquaintance with the ground
photographed or with similar regions and features. Without such a key
the air photograph is not always self-interpretative and is often
unintelligible. Military observers are carefully trained to recognize
features of military significance. It is not to be expected, however,
that they should be trained in the observation of land forms except such
as are of military importance. Consequently, whereas a great variety of
photographs is now easily obtainable at many flying fields, the
information that a scientist would desire concerning them is not so
easily available. Most of the photographs used in this paper were taken
by men who were not trained in observing land forms. Many were taken
simply as a requirement in practice flights and meant so little to the
observer that no record was made concerning them. For several not even
the location was recorded.</p>

<p>It is of primary importance that the picture be held in the right
position. Not only must the observer imagine himself looking directly
down on the scene but he must hold the photograph in the position in
which experience has shown that the image appears the most natural.
Otherwise a depression will appear as an elevation and an elevation as a
hollow. It is a well-known fact that in telescopic photographs of the
moon the craters appear like hollows when the print is held in one
position and like elevations when the position is reversed. Experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span>
shows that if the print is held <i>so that the shadows fall toward the
observer</i> the objects appear natural. The reason is that the observer
sees only those shadows that are caused by light falling towards him.
Consequently, the only interpretation that the brain can give to shadows
on a photograph is that they are cast by an elevation between the eye
and the light. In a picture, therefore, in which shadows fall away from
the eye instead of towards it valleys are seen as hills and hills as
valleys. In the northern hemisphere this prescribed orientation
conflicts with the convention of placing the north side of a map at the
top of the page and also with the modern shaded map on which the light
is represented as coming from the upper left, or northwest, corner of
the map.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Failure of Air Photographs to Show Relief, and Measures to Remedy This
Defect</span></h3>

<p>In photographs taken from the ground the lights and shadows are such
that a high degree of naturalness is possible. But objects seen from
directly above, and even those viewed obliquely, though to a lesser
degree, are illuminated so uniformly that photographs of them are apt to
appear flat. To some extent this has been overcome by the use of
extra-sensitive emulsions, special ray filters, and printing papers
adapted for accentuating contrast. Many of the photographs used in this
book did not allow satisfactory reproduction till the contrast of the
negatives was greatly increased by the arts of the photographic
laboratory. But, even at its best, no photograph taken vertically
affords an adequate idea of the height of hills or the depth of hollows.
Only shadows that are particularly well defined can be distinguished as
shadows, while small elevations and depressions affect the negative no
differently than a difference in marking or color. In military defenses,
if the mere surface of the camouflage is sufficiently realistic, the
ordinary camera is even more easily deceived than the human eye. It is a
well-known fact that man and other animals of the higher order see
objects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> relief, within a certain range of vision, because the eyes
convey to their respective retinas slightly different images of the same
object which the brain combines into a relief image. The stereoscopic
camera has long been used for the same purpose. Its principle, with
certain adaptations that need not be discussed here, has been to some
extent employed in airplane pictures, with such excellent results that
it is claimed by some that by further development actual contouring will
be possible by this means. It is reported that in military
reconnaissance stereoscopic pictures render ordinary camouflage useless
and that bridges, observation towers, gun emplacements, etc., are shown
in relief and, therefore, easily detected.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

FAMILIAR SCENES FROM A NEW ANGLE<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 1, 3, and 4</span>)</h2>

<p>Pictures of well-known buildings are of wide appeal. In so far as they
create an interest in the activities for which the buildings stand they
are distinctly educative. Such widely known buildings as the National
Capitol and the Library of Congress are used repeatedly for
illustration. They are as welcome as the sight of a familiar face. Any
unusual circumstance connected with them is seized upon as an excuse for
republishing pictures of them. Views of them from a new angle are always
in demand. Not only do air photographs offer a welcome novelty, but they
have the added advantage of lifting the subject out of the clutter of
surrounding buildings and making it really the central figure of the
picture. It would be difficult to get a more impressive view of the
National Capitol than that of Figure 1 or a more attractive glimpse of
the Naval Academy at Annapolis than that of Figure 4. The objects of
chief interest occupy the center of view without distracting
obstructions. In the former, the imposing structure of the Capitol
building appears in a pleasing setting of minor details. The proximity
of the Senate Office Building and the Library of Congress is at once
apparent, and the radiating systems of the avenues of approach.
Strangers may have wondered as to the nature of the environs of the
Capitol. The tree-lined streets and the apartment houses seen in the
picture answer the question. In the view of the Naval Academy the
buildings occupy the center of the scene, with the beautiful dome of the
memorial to John Paul Jones, the first great American naval fighter,
prominently in view. Spa Creek in the foreground, a part of the capital
city of Maryland at the left, and the Severn River, with its low wooded

ARCHITECTURE, LANDSCAPE GARDENING, AND ENGINEERING<br /><br />

<p>Only a few photographs are necessary to show how valuable to the
architect, the construction engineer, the city planner, or the landscape
gardener the air photograph, both vertical and oblique, is destined to
become. Pictorial records of progress in the construction of buildings,
bridges, ships, canals, reservoirs, etc., that partake also of the
nature of ground plans, as do air photographs, furnish an admirable
means of study and comparison. No photograph of the great shipyards at
Newport News taken from the ground would show the relation of the shops
and drydocks to the deep-water approaches as does Figure 7. Figure 8
gives an unusually comprehensive idea of the location, magnitude, and
construction of Hell Gate Bridge; and Figure 10, Rockaway Beach, now a
densely populated town where a few years ago was a barren strip of sand,
suggests that photographic records of construction in rapidly growing
communities where changes are being made in streets, railroads, and
buildings, will come to be a part of the equipment of the city engineer
and architect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Architecture and Landscape Gardening</span></h3>

<p>Equally useful will the air photograph become to the landscape gardener
and architect. Heretofore, in order to get a comprehensive conception of
his task and a definite picture of its completion, the landscape
gardener has had to depend upon the use of maps and such views as could
be made by the sketch artist or the ordinary lateral photograph. In the
future, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> vertical and oblique photographs of the area to be
developed, he will have the means of studying its features in their
correct proportions and relationship. By means of similar photographs of
completed projects he can choose and combine until he has developed the
plans best suited to his purpose. He can bring to his aid first-hand
studies of gardens and grounds the world over whose beauties have made
them famous.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
THE MOSAIC<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 13 and 22</span>)</h2>

<p>In its simplest form, the mosaic is made by mounting overlapping prints
so that the corresponding details coincide. This type of mosaic is quite
adequate for relatively small areas or where a high degree of accuracy
is not required. For larger areas and greater accuracy, an accurate
outline map is used as a base upon which the prints are mounted so that
recognizable features coincide with their location on the map. When the
prints are properly arranged, the better print of each overlapping pair
is selected, the excess paper removed, and the whole mounted and
photographed. Figure 13 is left untrimmed to illustrate the method of
matching the overlapping prints. The differences in shade are due to
difference in printing and developing the pictures which make up the
mosaic. The slight offsetting of line at the junction of the prints may
be due to errors in mounting, shrinking, or stretching of the
photographic paper, tilting of the camera at the time of exposure, or
other cause. Such errors and imperfections illustrate the difficulty of
using these photographs in the making of maps.</p>

<p>A skillful manipulation of both airplane and camera is necessary to the
success of the mosaic. To prevent distortion and variation of scale, the
camera must be maintained at the same altitude at all times and pointed
directly downward. This can be accomplished by flying with an even keel
at a uniform altitude. Mechanical devices are also being perfected to
accomplish the same result. Still greater skill is necessary when
consecutive rows of exposures are made for the purpose of placing strips
of photographs side by side to cover a large area. It is difficult under
the varying conditions of wind and weather to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> fly so evenly and so
nearly at the same level that distortions and differences in scale are
not noticeable. Strong objection to the mosaic is frequently raised
because of inaccuracies due to difference in scale in neighboring
prints. Until these defects are overcome, such a group of matched
photographs cannot take the place of an accurate map. Much, however, is
being done to correct these defects, and, even in photographs where
inaccuracies in scale are many, the value of the photograph for the
portrayal of detail cannot be denied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

others containing small thoroughfares, and still others drained by

the concentric lines of the terraced slopes have the appearance of

inference supported by the fact that the principal business center of

set farther apart and separated by lawns set with trees. Other less

city-like, with a business center, a densely populated residential
district, and a district of houses separated by grounds; others more

MARSHES AND MARSH DRAINAGE<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 19 to 27</span>)</h2>

<p>Mention has been made of the objects seen better from the air than from
any viewpoint on the ground; but there are some objects which as a whole
can be seen only from above. Swamps, parts of everglades, peaks in the
midst of difficult country, precipitous canyon walls, and many volcanic
craters cannot be seen from the ground without undue effort. Photographs
of bluffs, terraces, and other slopes facing bodies of water have
hitherto been adequately obtainable only from the water. All of these
can be readily viewed and photographed from the airplane. Pictorial
representations of drainage systems were rare until photographs such as
Figure 19 were taken from airplanes. The intricate drainage of marshes
like those along the Pamunkey River in Virginia pictured in Figure 20
was never accurately shown until photographed from the air.</p>

<p>Of frequent occurrence on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United
States are swamps and marshes inaccessible from the ground. Much of the
surface material is so soft that they cannot be easily traversed; and,
even where firm enough to support a man’s weight, few of the details are
deemed of sufficient importance to warrant the trouble and expense of
mapping by ordinary methods. Yet the trapper would scarcely admit that
these details are unimportant, and, to the student, they are an
interesting feature of marsh topography that has thus far received
little attention.</p>

<p>Figure 25 is part of the excellent New Kent, Va., sheet of the
topographic map and is probably as detailed as a map of this character
should be when made from ground surveys only. However, on comparison of
the map with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> photograph of the same area (Fig. 24), there is no
difficulty in detecting errors; and it is probable that, had the
photograph been available when the map was made, the marshes would have
been represented differently.</p>

close to the bank of the larger stream at the extreme left and flowing
in meandering courses across the marsh. The great variety of types of
vegetation probably is one cause of the remarkable meandering of these
drainage lines by reason of the fact that the accumulated remains as
well as the annual growth of different weeds and grasses offer varying
resistance to the current of the streams. Scale, about 1:10,000.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marsh Drainage</span></h3>

<p>One of the most striking characteristics of marsh topography illustrated
by the photographs presented here is the great wealth of drainage lines
and the resemblance of the drainage patterns to those of river systems
developed on higher ground. The dendritic patterns, the meanders, and
the sharply outlined divides are surprising in areas which have
altitudes varying from only a few inches to a little more than a foot at
times of ordinary high tide and which are wholly submerged at times of
maximum tide. Some of the streams have gently winding courses suggestive
of normal stream development. Others, particularly the smaller, have a
conspicuous angularity of course. It is possible that the latter may
have originated as the trails of animals. Some of the lines are observed
to cross the larger streams and are probably tracks made by muskrats.
Some of the streams rise close to the river’s brink and lead to
through-going waterways near the center of the marsh. This suggests the
deposition of silt on the brink of the river at times of high water. The
notched appearance of the shore in Figure 20 seems to be due to
overhanging bunches of sedge grass and, in some instances, to the
breaking away of the surface mat or crust of the marsh formed by the
interlacing roots of grass. The mottled appearance of the marsh in this
picture may be partly due to shadow of clouds, but to some extent, at
least, the difference in shade is caused by differences in the character
of the plants.</p>

<p>The marshes used for illustration here are typical of many along the
Atlantic Coast. They are situated near West Point, Va. The Pamunkey and
the Mattaponi Rivers both rise in the Piedmont Plateau, flow
southeastward through the tidewater<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> portion of Virginia, and join about

their form is made stable by the tough surface crust of the marsh,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>The York is one of the estuaries of the tidewater portion of Virginia,
and the water level at West Point, the junction of the two tributaries,
rises and falls about 3½ feet under tidal action. The Pamunkey is
affected by the tide 53 miles by channel above West Point, and the
Mattaponi 42 miles. Much of the broad lowland along these rivers is
marshy, but the largest marshes are found near West Point, where the
river current in swinging from side to side has formed great meanders.
For some reason the valleys eroded long ago by these streams have filled
with sediment here to a greater extent than farther downstream; perhaps
because this is essentially the head of sea water, so that the checking
of the current of the river causes it to deposit much of its load. Sea
water regularly mingles with the river water as far upstream as West
Point, but above this point the water is chiefly fresh. The marshes
consist of soft mud and muck to a considerable depth. A well driven in
Hill Marsh to an underlying artesian horizon penetrated 50 feet of this
soft material before entering rock such as is exposed in the river bank.
The thickness of the mud is comparable to the maximum depth of the York
farther downstream and suggests that the old valley which there is
filled with water is here filled to a depth of 50 feet or more with
sediment brought down by the river. Only a small part of the marsh near
the landward margin has surface material firm enough to support the
weight of large animals except when the surface is frozen.</p>

<p>Many kinds of marsh plants grow here, among which is sedge grass
(<i>Spartina cynosuroides</i> (L.) Willd.), which grows to a height of 10
feet or more and forms dense thickets. Its roots interlace<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> to form a
tough mat which in some places will support the weight of a man. In
other places the soft muck reaches to the surface.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Thoroughfares</span>”</h3>

<p>These marshes are cut by a few waterways open at both ends, known as
thoroughfares, or tidal runs, which also serve as the trunk streams
through which the marsh is drained. Some of the thoroughfares may be
trunk streams modified by tides, or they may be silted remnants of
abandoned river channels. Some seem to be channels in the last stages of
silting. The incoming tide enters the down-river end but ascends the
thoroughfare more slowly than it ascends the river. The tide in the
river reaches the upper end of the thoroughfare, enters it, and meets
the opposing tide within the marsh near the upstream end of the
passageway. Where the tides meet, thus causing slack water, silt is
deposited and mud flats are formed. In Eltham Marsh (Fig. 26) these
flats are well within the marsh. In the larger thoroughfares of Sweet
Hall Marsh (Fig. 24) the tide passes entirely through while the tide in
the river is making its long way around, so that slack water and the
deposition of silt occur at the extreme upper end of the passage. In all
of the thoroughfares the silting has reached the stage that precludes
their use by boat, except at times of high water. Even at high tide some
are navigable only by small skiffs, although throughout much of the
course the water is many feet deep.</p>

<p>Some of the thoroughfares become narrow and shallow upstream in a manner
that suggests that they originate as two normal streams flowing in
opposite directions from a common point and that they were later united
by the breaking down of the divide between their headwaters. Such a
junction might be affected by an unusually high tide breaking through a
divide and cutting a channel. Such a divide, be it noted, consists of
soft mud only a few inches above the general level and might readily be
broken down. In some instances the connection may have originated as an
animal trail, as we have seen. Muskrats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> otters, and other marsh
animals use the waterways as lines of travel and make paths in between
them from one to another. Apparently many of the small drainage lines
originated in this way, but in some instances stream systems of
considerable size and complexity are independent of all others and
possess all the characteristics of normally developed river systems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
COASTAL MUD FLATS<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 28 and 29</span>)</h2>

<p>Of frequent occurrence along the Atlantic Coast of the United States are
low mud flats which are practically at sea level and which are covered
with water at times of high tide. Where these tracts are exposed to the
air during ebb tide for so short a time that plants have not taken root
and where the surface material is fine-grained and soft, the tracts are
known as mud flats. In the part of the peninsula between Delaware and
Chesapeake Bays belonging to the state of Virginia which is called the
Eastern Shore a low barrier beach of sand has formed on the ocean side
several miles off shore, and the space between this and the mainland is
occupied by mud flats, broad, shallow lagoons, and an intricate maze of
interlacing channels and winding, branching, interlocking, vermicular
streams.</p>

<p>The mud flats are exposed for a short time during low tide, and, as the
surface of the water here rises and falls with the tide more than 4
feet, with a maximum fluctuation considerably greater, large volumes of
water are continually flowing backward and forward over the flats. As
the tide rises, strong currents of sea water set in through the inlets,
flow up the main channels and through the thoroughfares, and gradually
find their way into the countless small channels and out of them over
the broad level stretches of soft mud. As the tide falls, this action is
reversed, and the broad sheet of water finds its way by devious paths
through the winding watercourses out to sea. The larger channels extend
considerably below the surface at times of highest water and may be
quite deep even at times of low water. They are, perhaps, stream courses
excavated before the region was drowned. Many of the smaller channels
also have the gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>eral form characteristic of normal stream channels,
although others show peculiarities not common to subaerial drainage. The
origin of these submarine and tidal features is not well understood, but
the photographs of them show their form and furnish some basis for a
study of them.</p>

SUBMERGED LAND FORMS<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 30 to 33</span>)</h2>

<p>Heretofore the study of beaches, deltas, and other partly submerged land
forms has been chiefly confined to the exposed parts, the underwater
forms being largely matters of conjecture. By means of air photographs
not only can the exposed parts of the delta and beach be studied, but
the forms of shoals and terraces, the underwater portions of river
deltas, tidal deltas and their underwater distributaries, and many other
submerged forms can be shown clearly. Sand bars, terraces, and other
submerged forms appear in many of the photographs already presented; but
a few so taken that the bars and terraces appear to be the chief objects
in the picture may be useful for illustrating the underwater land forms
and for demonstrating that these forms can be successfully photographed.
Unfortunately not many photographs could be found which were taken with
the express object in view of illustrating underwater land features. In
most of the available photographs these features were only incidental,
the chief purpose in taking them being to photograph the shore.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning the physiographic history of the
Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States, and the question is still
being debated whether the land is rising, sinking, or stationary. To
some extent these questions are answered by the exposed land forms. The
submarine forms are imperfectly known. The possibility of recognizing
shoals and channels from a photograph and of determining in some measure
the shapes of the submerged land forms opens a new avenue of approach to
the study of submarine geography. In some places, especially in regions
of drowned topography, it is possible that, by using the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> air photograph
in working out the physiographic processes that have produced the land
forms that are now under water, some of the vexing problems of earth
history may be solved.</p>

<p class="nind">times he can see with great distinctness. In trying to ascertain the
most favorable conditions for such observation, it was found that
submerged objects are seen best when the sky is evenly overcast or when
it is uniformly clear. Sometimes when the sky is only partly cloudy the
surface of the water seems to act as a mirror and nothing is seen but
the reflection of cloud and sky. Waves have less effect on the
visibility of objects beneath the surface than was expected, although
they diffuse the reflected light to some extent and consequently weaken
the image on the negative. But the reflected light from the surface of
the water is stronger than that coming from objects under water. Hence,
to photograph underwater features successfully, a time should be chosen
when direct reflection of light from the sun or from a brightly
illuminated cloud will not enter the lens.</p>

<p>Experience in both the air and the laboratory shows that the best
results are likely to be obtained when the sunlight strikes the surface
at an oblique angle. In summer favorable times are mid-forenoon or
mid-afternoon under an evenly illuminated sky. In winter the sun is low
enough at midday to avoid direct reflection into the lens. But
experience also indicates that often photographs taken at moments when
the eye caught the image of a submerged object show only the surface of
the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span></p>

THE PLAIN FROM THE AIR<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 34 to 41</span>)</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A River on the Great Plains</span></h3>

<p>The difficulty of photographing a plain from a point on its surface
needs no emphasis, but its successful representation by means of air
photographs is illustrated by many figures in this book. The Great
Plains of the west-central part of the United States are illustrated
here by a view of the Red River (Fig. 36), which shows the flat surface
of the land and the broad sandy bed of the river only partly covered by
the intricately woven strands of the braided channels&mdash;a scene
characteristic of the Great Plains.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Meandering Streams on the Coastal Plain</span></h3>

<p>The ox-bow curves of meandering streams are among the features of the
earth’s surface most familiar to the student of physical geography; yet,
heretofore, they have been illustrated only by maps, constructed at
great labor and expense. Comprehensive photographs of them are rare and
are, at best, imperfect and unsatisfactory for purposes of illustration.
On the other hand, meandering streams lend themselves admirably to air
photography. Equally familiar to the student of geography and
physiography is the term “abandoned meander.” These ancient stream
courses, many of which are now occupied by marsh, brush, or forest, have
been still more difficult to illustrate by means of photographs. In some
instances wooded meanders like those near Columbus, Ga. (Fig. 34), long
ago abandoned by the stream that formed them, are shown in air pictures
in a manner but little less conspicuous than the meanders of the
present-day stream. It is believed that instructors will find Figure 34
useful, not only in illustrating meandering streams and abandoned
meanders but also in showing how meanders develop.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 34</span>&mdash;The Chattahoochee River south of Columbus, Ga.,
showing the results of progressive lateral shifting of a meandering
stream. In the upper part of the illustration to the left (west) of the
stream are light-colored concentric markings which probably represent
the gradual shifting of the stream toward the right. As interpreted from
the information at hand, this section of the stream at one time occupied
a position much farther west than now. It cut away the bank on the east,
forming a curved course, depositing sand and mud on the inside of the
curve. This typical feature of stream erosion and deposition is to be
noted from the picture of the present course of the stream. At the
outside of each meander stretches of the bank appear light-colored and
denuded of the trees and bushes that line the bank elsewhere. These are
scours, a slipping away of the bluff caused by the cutting of the stream
into the foot of the bank at points where the velocity of the outside of
the current, and consequently its corrosive power, is increased as it
swings round the curve. The inside of the sharpest meander shows also
the deposit of material due to the fact that the velocity of the inside
of the current is checked by the bank, causing it to deposit some of its
load. Added to this deposit is much of the material brought by
cross-currents from the opposite-lying scour. The light-colored banks
are probably successive deposits. Finally, either by a gradual wearing
away or by some whim of the current at flood tide, the river chose a
shorter course, leaving its old channel as an abandoned meander. Farther
south several abandoned meanders may be distinguished, each
distinctively marked by a steep bank on the outside of the curve and
concentric bandings on the inside. The abandoned channels are especially
marked by the trees and brush that fill them in many places. It appears
that a well-developed growth of trees is to be found only along the
river banks in this region and the growth in the abandoned channels is
probably due to the fact that in flood time there is much seepage of
water into these old channels if not an actual overflow from the present
course of the stream. At the bottom of the picture is to be seen the
recently made land under cultivation. The fields appear striated and

more than a mile wide, which is completely covered with water only at
flood time. The river forms the Texas-Oklahoma boundary, and frequent
changes in the position of the channel during periods of high water make
the exact position of the interstate boundary uncertain and give rise to

<p>These photographs were selected from a series taken as an experiment in
map-making. In June, 1920, the United States Air Service sent a plane
equipped with a K-1 camera from Dayton, Ohio, to Schoolcraft, Mich,
where in seven hours’ flying time a fifteen-minute quadrangle, about 220
square miles, was photographed. The prints were matched together and
reduced to a scale of 1:48,000. From them such features as roads,
streams, forests, land corners, etc., were transferred to plane-table
sheets, which the topographic engineers on the ground then used for
contouring the relief. Figure 38 is a part of the preliminary proof of
this map. It may be added that the experiment is regarded as highly
favorable to the use of the airplane camera as an instrument in
mapping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br /><br />
MOUNTAIN FEATURES<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Figs. 42 to 52</span>)</h2>

<p>In obtaining photographic illustrations from the ground of mountains,
canyons, and associated land forms, the same difficulty, but in
exaggerated form, is encountered that obtains in securing an
advantageous point of view for small objects. The difficulty is overcome
in large measure by the use of aircraft. In an airplane the observer can
rise above the obstructions which interfere with the view desired; can
look an isolated mountain peak squarely in the face, as in the case of
the photograph of Mt. Shasta (Fig. 42); can study the details of its ice
cap (Fig. 42) and gaze downward on the lateral and recessional moraines
left by the retreat of the mountain’s glaciers (Fig. 43). Few volcanic
craters, occurring as they do at the top of cones, have been
successfully photographed unless some higher mountain stands near-by on
which a favorable viewpoint can be found. From an airplane, however, one
can look into the very throat of a crater, as into that of Cinder Cone
(Fig. 48), near Lassen Peak, California.</p>

<p>Much attention has been given to the interrelations of canyons, gorges,
and mountain ridges, but these relations have hitherto been illustrated
chiefly by means of maps and charts. Figures 49, 50, and 52 picture
three relations more expressively than any map. To the experienced
geographer a map may illustrate perfectly the action of a stream working
headward into higher land; but the student to whom the conception of
headward erosion is new will certainly grasp the idea more readily from
the picture presented in Figure 52. No map could give so clear a
conception of a maturely dissected highland as does a photograph like
that of the Santa Monica Mountains (Fig. 50).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span></p>

<p>These photographs have the advantage of appealing to the mind through
the sense of vision and will serve the same purpose as plaster models.
Thus, in Figure 52, a variety of topographic forms are to be
distinguished, including slightly dissected highlands with sharply
incised gorges; maturely dissected highlands made up now of canyons and
ridges; a mountain valley broadening out toward an intermontane plain;
several arroyos; and many minor features.</p>

<p>In the interpretation of the features shown in a vertical view of a
mountainous country the orientation of the photograph is of prime
importance. When viewed in proper orientation, that is, as already
pointed out (p. 5), with the shadows falling toward the observer,
mountains and valleys appear in their correct relation. But, if the
position of the picture is reversed, a mountain will look like a
depression and a valley like a ridge. This reversal of the image can be
tested by looking at Figures 49 or 52 from both viewpoints. However,
since the vertical photographs will be compared with maps of the same
area, it is thought better to place them on the page as if they were
maps. In order to make them appear natural the prints can be turned in
the necessary direction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />
AIR CRAFT IN THE STUDY OF ROCKS AND ORES<br /><br />
(<span class="smcap">Fig. 53</span>)</h2>

<p>The admirable manner in which air photography lends itself to the
observation of geographic relations and physiographic processes suggests
its use as a valuable addition to the instruments of geologic
reconnaissance; for, not only is the study of geology inseparable from
that of physiography, but, in large measure, geology is applied physical
geography and many conclusions of a geologic nature are drawn from
observed surface relations.</p>

<p>Probably, in most cases, the actual character and composition of rocks
cannot be determined from air photographs; but, just as on a good map an
area of crystalline rocks can be distinguished from one of sedimentary
rocks by means of the topographic expression, so areas of different
rocks can be distinguished on photographs. For instance, an area of
upturned sedimentary rocks would be readily distinguished from one of
horizontal rocks. Figure 42 shows how the character of glaciated
mountains is revealed, and Figures 37 to 41 of the Michigan area show
well the familiar features of continental glaciation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps premature to say much of the use of the airplane in the
study of geology until it has been thoroughly tested. But it should be
possible from the air to locate and map ore bodies, metalliferous veins,
and outcrops of rock: for it is well known that rocks at the outcrop
differ in color, in the forms of erosion developed in them, and in the
kind of plants which they support. It is of interest that Colonel Alfred
H. Brooks, who was Chief Geologist of the American Expeditionary Forces
in France during the war, found that geologic boundaries could be
recognized on air photographs and that by means of these photographs he
could correct existing geologic maps and identify<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">formations in inaccessible areas within the enemy lines. His method was
to use air photographs in the study of the geologic formations of areas
accessible to him. Then, having familiarized himself with the appearance
of the different rock formations and structures on the photographs, he
was able to recognize the same features on photographs of areas held by
the enemy and so project his mapping over into inaccessible
territory.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The prospector should effect a great saving of time by using air
photographs to guide him to places where he can find exposures of rock
and to help him to avoid places where it would be useless to look for
exposures. Particularly in wooded regions air photographs are valuable
in indicating localities where exposures can be found in areas so
covered with forest that examination on the ground would not be worthy
of consideration. Prospectors for oil are planning to use airplanes for
this purpose in northern Canada, in South America, and in other places
where much of the country is so densely wooded that much time is usually
spent in looking for clear space.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Use in Exploration</span></h3>

<p>Exploratory work should benefit in many ways. General reconnaissance has
been carried on to a considerable extent in foreign lands with airplanes
and to some extent also in America. Wide areas along the Mexican border
have been photographed for the making of new maps and for the correction
of existing maps. The same photographs would be useful in geologic
reconnaissance. The new photographs of southern Arizona are said to show
mountain ranges many miles away from their location on existing maps.
Such corrections are of importance to the geologist as well as to the
geographer and the map-maker. Amundsen intends to employ several small
planes in his Arctic work now under way. Mjöberg<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has projected an
expedition to New Guinea in which the use of airplanes is a fundamental
condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

camera is destined to become a valuable addition to the map-maker’s
equipment. The extent to which it will be used depends, of course, upon
the degree to which its present imperfections are corrected and its
possibilities developed. The Board of Surveys and Maps of the United

<p>Although most vertical airplane photographs are in the nature of
large-scale maps, this view illustrates how a large area can be covered
in an oblique view taken at a high altitude&mdash;an area, when transformed,
of appreciable size even on a small-scale map, such as, for example,
Fig. 55.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scale and Horizontal Control Of Vertical Photographs</span></h3>

<p>The vertical photographs taken with an air camera are, of course, of the
order of large-scale maps.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> For a lens of 6-inch focus the scale at an
elevation of 2,500 feet will be 1:5,000; at 5,000 feet, 1:10,000; and at
10,000 feet, 1:20,000.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Air mapping, therefore, lends itself best to
the production of such maps as engineering maps, city plans, topographic
maps, and coast charts. In all of these maps a degree of accuracy is
demanded that will give the exact location of all the features included
on the map and permit the precise measurement of distances between them.
To obtain such accuracy necessitates an elaborate system of control
stations as a basis on which the surveyor works out his triangulations
and traverses. In the United States these controls have been established
principally by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> To
construct a map from air photographs, varying in scale and distorted as
they often are because of the impossibility of holding the plane at an
absolute level and because of the stretching or shrinkage of the
photographic paper, would require a great amount of triangulation and
traverse in order that the control might be sufficiently detailed to
permit the accurate mounting of the photographic prints. But, given
these controls, the air camera can, without further adaptation, supply
details that heretofore required the laborious processes of plane-table
mapping. The topographer can place the two-dimensional details from
photographs and then go into the field with only the contouring to be
done.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Use in City Mapping</span></h3>

<p>In city mapping, even though time be taken to establish a very elaborate
system of controls, the air camera can accomplish in a few hours a task
of years by ordinary methods. In fact it is only by means of air
photographs that maps of a growing city can be kept at all up to date.
Paris was mapped with 800 plates in less than one day of actual flying.
Washington was completely mapped in two and a half hours with less than
200 exposures.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> For the mosaic of Rochester, N. Y. (Fig. 56) 82
photographs were made in one hour and twenty minutes. There is no reason
why such a mosaic with an original survey or even a number of accurately
located points as a basis of control should not be sufficiently accurate
for all purposes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Use in Revision of Existing Maps</span></h3>

<p>Another immediate use of air photographs in mapping is in the correction
and revision of existing maps. So far as individual features are
concerned, the air photograph is an exact record of the area exposed to
its lens, and natural and artificial features are easily transferred
from the picture to the map. Its great value in the saving of time and
money has been demonstrated in the rapidly developing territory near Los
Angeles. In 1893 the Santa Monica quadrangle was surveyed, and houses,
roads, etc., as they existed at that time, are shown on the map. This
area was later built up and so changed that the map was practically
worthless. From information derived from air photographs the map was
revised in 1920 (Fig. 51). Evidence has already been given of the
efficiency of the air photograph in elaborating maps where the
importance of the region is not sufficient to warrant the expense of a
detailed survey of minor features, and in mapping areas inaccessible
from the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span></p>

<p>It is fortunate for those engaged in the study of shore features and the
mapping of coasts that, being flat, shore features are particularly well
adapted to representation by air photographs, for on coasts exposed to
the wind and waves the channels, shoals and bars are continually
changing. Air photography offers a quick and convenient means of keeping
charts up to date. The intricacies of the water line in some places
makes accurate charting by the ordinary survey methods a slow, laborious
process. When bluffs or relatively steep slopes, like those of York

submerged or perhaps exposed at low tide, where dark-colored drainage

<p class="nind">occur along the shore, the water line varies little from year to year.
But on very low lands, like those along Chesapeake Bay south of the
mouth of York River, shown in Figure 59, the strand may migrate over a
broad belt between high and low tide. For this reason it is desirable
that photographs of areas affected by the tide be accompanied by a
record of the date and time of day at which the exposure was made, in
order that the height of the tide at the time of exposure can be
computed. As the shore on the Coast and Geodetic Survey charts denotes
the water line at high tide, a photograph taken at low tide might be
interpreted as indicating an error on the chart. Where the water
migrates over such a broad belt of sand or mud, the prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>lems of
charting become very troublesome. Photographs of such areas could be
taken at both low and high tide, and from these the belt of daily

side, about 28 miles downstream from Washington. The “Bay” is the
widened part of the stream at its entrance into the Potomac, which is
entered by the tide. Forested land appears at the right and left, with
light-colored fields at the left. The space between the wooded areas is
occupied by shallow water, beneath which appears the relatively deep
channel, which forks after the manner of streams. The branching channel
is wholly under water and differs in some respects from the channel of a
normal stream. Among the more obvious peculiarities is the “fanning
out,” of the headwaters. Photograph taken from a height of about 18,000

<p class="nind">escaped attention during very detailed surveys. He states that with
proper plates and ray filters the presence of objects invisible to the
eye is revealed by the camera.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Similar use of air photographs has
been made by the English in charting reefs, shallows, and harbors.
Thomas says: “In 1917 aeroplane photography was successfully used for
charting the harbor of Rahbeg on the Arabian coast.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is a
well-known fact that, under proper conditions, objects submerged to a
considerable depth under clear water can be seen from points high above
the surface. During the war, submarines were detected and followed by
observers in airplanes, and sunken vessels, mines, and other submerged
objects have been located by observation from the air. Illustrations in
this paper show the possibility of using this method of observation, to
some extent at least, in detecting and mapping shoals, channels, and
other features under water.</p>

<p>Photographs of channels like those of the Potomac River and its
tributaries will be commercially as well as scientifically valuable. The
deep-water channel of the Potomac is well known and has been charted;
but very little is known of many of the small tributary channels, such
as that of Powells Creek (Fig. 75). Where the channels are not well
known, such a photograph could be used to advantage in avoiding the
shoals, and, by surveyors, first in exploratory work and later as a
general guide in charting. Small boats entering this channel could use
the photographs either for the original location of the deep channel in
case no chart were available or for detecting changes in its course
after the chart was made. For uncharted channels, like those of many of
the tributaries of the Potomac River, air<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> photography furnishes a quick
and accurate means of location.</p>

<p>No amount of sounding, charting, or description could produce so
accurate a mental picture of a drowned valley as that produced by Figure
76. In Figures 78 and 79, both of which were taken near Miami, Florida,
is illustrated the difference in appearance between natural and
artificial channels. The straightaway course and regular outlines of the
dredged channel contrast sharply with the winding course and merging
outlines of the natural channel. To the student of physiography and
earth history the photographs furnish a means of observation of a
definiteness heretofore quite unthought-of. On them the actual shape of
the channels, submerged terraces, and drowned land forms are shown in
detail.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Improvements Under Way Point to Promising Outlook for Airplane
Photography</span></h3>

<p>There is, however, need of careful research to determine the conditions
under which the best results can be obtained. The height and time of day
for exposures with a certain lens, the emulsion and kind of ray filter
best suited under certain conditions, the effect of light as it enters
and emerges from the water, and the effect of polarization are subjects
demanding consideration. Chief among the experiments now under way is
the determination of the kind of emulsion and ray filter or color screen
that will give the best results. It is a demonstrated fact that, with an
emulsion sensitive to red light, objects in the air invisible to the eye
because of intervening haze can be photographed through a red filter. It
is possible that water can be penetrated in the same way and that
filters of other colors will prove advantageous.</p>

<p>Certainly, the air photograph is only in its infancy&mdash;but an infancy
full of promise. As a means of securing new and advantageous views of
subjects of interest, it is not only entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span> but scientifically
and commercially valuable. As an aid in mapping it can, even in its
present stage of development, serve an important purpose by supplying
accurate knowledge of otherwise inaccessible regions, by furnishing
details that are valuable but expensive to obtain, and by permitting the
frequent and inexpensive revision of existing maps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span></p>
